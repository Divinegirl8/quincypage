        Quincy Tobenna Alagbu — also known as Toben Quincy and Sir Quincy — is a multi-award-winning writer, editor, ghostwriter, voice-over artist, and writing coach with a commanding presence in the world of storytelling. Renowned for his ability to craft compelling narratives and build unforgettable brands through words, Quincy has collaborated with international personalities and businesses, judged global literary contests, and led fast-growing writing communities that empower emerging voices. As a literary force with a passion for impact, Quincy has mentored numerous writers who have gone on to become successful authors. Whether ghostwriting riveting memoirs or crafting persuasive content, he brings precision, creativity, and heart to every project. He is also a six-foot-four librocubicularist who can often be found reading multiple books at once. When he is not reading, working his magic with words, or daydreaming up tales — mostly action-packed Afro-futuristic tales — he is either indulging his inner foodie or sketching things and pairing them with beautiful pieces of poetry. He is currently working on his first long-form novel, rooted in the Afro-fantasy genre.
